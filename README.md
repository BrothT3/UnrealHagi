# UnrealHagiProjekt

You play as a man waking up in an enclosed IKEA parking lot, upon entering the store the doors close behind you and the light turns off.
Inside the big foggy building you are met with a patrolling blue character, that flashes yellow to show his pride in Sweden.
When he spots you he will start playing the Swedish national anthem, Basshunter - Boten anna, and will chase you down.
If he catches you, you will return to the start of the map.
If you make it till the end, you will return to the start but with an additional enemy patrolling.
Your only defence is your speed and your ability to hit R and drop a giant meatball that will launch the enemies backwwards.
